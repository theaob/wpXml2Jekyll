## What is wpXml2Jekyll?

wpXml2Jekyll is a tool that converts your Wordpress XML file to individual [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) &amp; [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/) compatible markdown posts.

1. There **are** many post extractors for most of the blogging frameworks out there, some may offer more options
2. This tool **doesn't** require any database connection for post generation
3. Hell, if you've downloaded the required files before, you may not need any internet connection

## Usage

You can download wpXml2Jekyll v1.2 from [here](https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll/raw/v1.2/wpXml2Jekyll.exe) as a compiled binary or for the [**releases** section](https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll/releases). You can run the executable as a windows application or run it on console as:
```
wpXml2Jekyll [wordpress export file] [output folder]
```
## Why The Weird Name?

It may **look** weird but it is actually very self explanatory.
